Hello world !

This is my modest attempt to solve the python challenge here http://www.pythonchallenge.com/
It is a good practise to go through different python libraries and to challenge your mind at the same time.

My code is not to most efficient and I will be glad to see your proposition of factorisation, simplification, and so on.
